### The Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre
- The [Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre](https://pawsey.org.au/about-us/about-pawsey/) is one of two, Tier-1, High Performance Computing facilities in Australia, whose primary function is to accelerate scientific research for the benefit of the nation.
- Pawsey service and expertise in supercomputing, data, cloud services and visualisation, enables research across a spread of domains including astronomy, life sciences, medicine, energy, resources and artificial intelligence.
- Nimbus cloud from Pawsey can help the reserachers scale their problems and make them solvable in a reasonable timeframe.
- Often confusing, the document [Cloud computing at Pawsey](https://pawseysupercomputing.github.io/using-nimbus/02-cloud-at-pawsey/index.html) can help the user understand the differences between cloud computing and supercomputing.


### What is a Nimbus instance?
- On a local machine, we perform data processing and storage which are available locally to perform your research. This might include: moving, cleaning and visualising data; writing and or installing programs to analyse data. 
- The difference with cloud computing is that you are working remotely, rather than on a local machine.
- Nimbus instance is a virtual machine (VM) located on Nimbus servers, that you use in place of your laptop or desktop computer.

## Logging into a Nimbus instance

### The three main requirements
- The first requirement is the **IP Address**, the virtual address of your instance. ###.###.###.###
- Every participant is provided with an separate IP Address which points to an independant VM instance on the Pawsey Nimbus servers.
- The second information required is your **login name**: this depends on the name of the Linux OS image you selected and in our case it is ```ubuntu```.
- The third requirement is the location and name of your **private key**. This is provided as file in the folder XXX.

### How to log-in
- The primary means by which we can connect to this VM is via a Secure Shell (SSH) over a Command Line Interface (CLI).
- Type the following into your terminal, using your login name and the instance’s IP address:
```
$ ssh -i `name_of_your_key`.pem `login_name`@###.###.###.###
```

- You will receive a message saying:
```
The authenticity of host '146.118.67.137 (146.118.67.137)' can't be established.
```
- Remember your host address will be different than the one above.
- There will be a message saying
```
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
```
- If you are sure (and/or confirm the fingerprint), answer ‘yes’ to continue. It will then give a warning,
```
Warning: Permanently added '146.118.67.137' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
```
Meaning that next time you log in using this key and IP address you won’t receive this message. Having done that, your terminal should then display something like that shown in the figure below:

**Congratulations, you have now successfully logged on to your instance!**
