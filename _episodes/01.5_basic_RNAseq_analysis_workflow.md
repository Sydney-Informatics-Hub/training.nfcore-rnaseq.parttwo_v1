### RNA-seq analysis workflow

- Multiple steps are involved in the analysis of RNA-Seq data. 
- The first step is sequencing the reads. The format of the sequenced reads is called **[FASTQ](https://www.drive5.com/usearch/manual7/fastq_files.html)**.

#### The FASTQ format
- FASTQ files are text files containing sequence data with a quality (Phred) score for each base.

</p>

- The above example shows a FASTQ read with 50nt in Illumina format (ASCII_BASE=33).
- There are always four lines per read.
- The four lines which represent a read in FASTQ are 
  - The first line starts with '@', followed by the label.
  - The second line contains the actual sequence.
  - The third line starts with '+'. In some variants, the '+' line contains a second copy of the label.
  - The fourth line contains the Q scores represented as ASCII characters.
- The quality score is an integer (Q) which is typically in the range 2 - 40


#### Pre-processing 
- Next step involves pre-processing for quality control (QC). A range of different tools can be used for performing an array of important function related tp data pre-processing for quality assessment etc.

#### Alignment
- Next the good quality reads are aligning to a reference genome. 
- The number of reads mapped to each gene are then counted. This results in a table of counts.

#### Differential expression analysis 
- The table of genecounts is used to perform statistical analyses to determine 
   - The differentially expressed genes.
   - Functionally important pathways.

- Each tool in the RNA-Seq pipeline is developed independantly and needs sufficient resources for excecution.
