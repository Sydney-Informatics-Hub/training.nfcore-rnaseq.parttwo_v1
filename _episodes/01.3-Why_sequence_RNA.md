- [Gene expression](https://www.yourgenome.org/facts/what-is-gene-expression) is the process by which the instructions in our DNA are converted into a functional product, such as a protein or other molecules.
   - The central dogma highlights the process of information transfer between information-carrying polymers; DNA, RNA and proteins.
   - The first step is called transcription which involves production of an RNA copy called messenger RNA (mRNA) from DNA. 
   - mRNA is translated into proteins by a process called  translation in 'ribosomes' of the cell.
   - Non-coding RNA (ncRNAs) is processed and assume their functional structures after transcription and without going into translation.

- RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) uses the capabilities of high-throughput sequencing methods to provide insight into the transcriptome of a cell. 
- Using RNA-Seq we can :
  - Identify which gene is expressed & how much of it is being expressed under a specific condition.
  - Identify variants (SNPs)and allele specific expression.
  - Identify novel genes.
  - Assemble the transcriptome of an organism.
  - Identify alternative splice forms.
- The experimental condition(s) for a RNA-seq experiment can range from healthy , diseased patient samples to samples affected by a new drug etc.
