**An introduction to RNA-seq analysis using the Nextflow bioinformatics pipeline nfcore-rnaseq**

**About this workshop**
- ```RNA-seq``` is a popular method for simultaneously measuring and comparing the expression of tens of thousands of genes in multiple samples.
- ```Nextflow``` is a workflow management tool which assists in pipelining the multiple steps and also enables scalability and reproducibility of these workflows across different compute infrastructures.
- This workshop provides a hands-on introduction to RNA-seq analysis from reads to counts to differential expression to functional enrichments.
- The workshop makes use of nfcore-rnaseq, a nextflow pipeline that allows the researchers to use computational data analysis tools and workflows without the need for programming experience.
- The nfcore-rnaseq pipeline will be run on a ```Training Virtual Machine (VM) instance``` provided by Pawsey supercomputing center.
- The workshop also introduces the attendies to the use of ```R environment using RStudio``` for basic downstream analysis of RNA-seq data.

**Target audience**<br>
HDR students, researchers who have or will soon acquire RNA-seq short-read data which they need to analyse themselves or others who desire to understand how to perform RNA-seq analysis using workflow management tools such as Nextflow.

**Lead trainers:**
