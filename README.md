# RNASeq workshop

Hello

This readme file does nothing for the website/course, but you can add some internal notes here (but remember it is a public facing page, don't add an API key or something!)

This site is rendered at [https://sydney-informatics-hub.github.io/bio-temp/](https://sydney-informatics-hub.github.io/bio-temp/)

Changes to the Episodes are done in \_episodes

Changes to the front-matter and setup and all the other stuff is done in.... "\_config.yml", "index.md" and probably a few other locations. You might want to delete a few of the dropdowns in the header bar if approriate (Extras, License, Suggest Edits, etc).
